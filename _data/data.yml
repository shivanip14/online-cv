        Final GPA 8.90. Projects undertaken:
          - Hotel Recommendation Engine using ML
            Implemented a recommender system using Expedia’s dataset to optimize the rankings and increase bookings (also submitted as a response to a then-ongoing Kaggle challenge).

          - Data Compression (principal focus on images)
            Developed a hybrid algorithm (based on the JPEG2000 standard) for image compression with performance comparable to industry standards of the time.

          - Flight Delay Prediction (Python with Django framework)
            Utilized real time metrics gathered from MLAT and ADS-B receivers around the world along with historical data to build and train ML models in order to predict flight arrival and departure delays.
experiences:
    - role: Analyst
      time: Jun 2018 - Aug 2021
      company: Goldman Sachs
      details: |
        - Mobile Cheque Deposits
            - Lead developer in building a microservice architecture for cheque submissions via GS' mobile banking app.
            - Implemented a validation engine that verifies the authenticity of a submitted cheque with predefined business rules in addition to those derived from previously rejected cheques.
            
        - Straight Through Processing (STP) of transfers
            - Engineered STP of transfers initiated by ultra high-net worth Private Wealth Management clients from the Goldman banking website using Kafka pipeline combined with a microservice architecture, with near-real time persistence of such transfers in the ledgers - compared to the legacy flow taking ~4-6 min.
            - Improved Ops’ daily efficiency by ~9% by eliminating manual entry via legacy flow.
            - Built a rules engine that leverages metrics captured from current transfers data, to select the best data points for auto-approvals of the now-increased volumes of transfers and storage in ElasticSearch for faster retrievals, resulting in further improvements in Ops’ efficiency.            
    - role: Summer Intern
      time: Jan 2018 - May 2018
      company: Goldman Sachs
      details: |
        Interned in the Private Wealth Management (PWM) division of GS (focusing on the EU financial legislative framework MiFID II) as a final year CS student, which ultimately resulted in a pre-placement offer as Analyst.
